# Questions 4 and 5 on the project

## Two photons
Run with `python3 two_photon_spectra.py`. Should pop up some plots.

Emission spectrum from two photon emission. Basically,
* The spectrum has a shape in nu/lambda which depends on the probability or releasing photons at various energies. Obvious a photon can't have negative energy or have more than the energy difference between n=2 and n=1 in Hydrogen. This distribution comes from Osterbrock.
* Scale this spectrum by the the number of peturbing particles and some constants to get total emission.

## Hydrogen lines
Run with `python3 hydrogen_lines.py`. Should pop up some plots.
